A discord bot that helps you out with figuring out what music to play! 

Ever been in a call where noone knows want song they want to hear your discord bot play? Or maybe noone is brave enough to bear the responsibilities of choosing for the squad? 

This dude'll help you out. 

Use .s or .search followed by a song title to help get him started, then enjoy(or laugh at) the playlist he makes for you!

.S [song title] ((note the capital S) will show you exactly what songs he pulls up. 

I didn't program emotions into him yet so you can totally skip songs guilt-free or blame him for your bad music taste.
